# Langfuse Bug Fix Loop Ledger

## Purpose
Track recent Langfuse sessions/traces inspected so this loop does not repeat the same evidence without new signals.

## Recently inspected
| Date | Session ID | Trace ID | Outcome | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-03-09 | `conv_1773024143793_v7qtjonjy` | `session_1773024143795_wrbpe7lkn` | Not a product bug | `discord-recap-tweeter-v3` skill file was created after the failed run, so no code fix justified. |
| 2026-03-09 | `conv_1773028533776_ldsjpjgh5` | `session_1773028533777_0ya0av86q` | Fixed | Main agent over-delegated a simple repo question to `augustus`; user had to correct the system. |

## Iteration notes

### 2026-03-09 - Prompt over-delegation fix
- Started by reviewing `apps/desktop/OBSERVABILITY.md` and `apps/desktop/DEBUGGING.md`.
- Dismissed one false lead where a skill genuinely did not exist yet.
- Chosen issue: mandatory delegation guidance caused a poor first run on a simple repo question.

#### Evidence
- Scope: Reduce unnecessary delegation in ACP main-agent runs when the task is simple enough to answer directly with available tools.
- Before evidence: Langfuse trace `session_1773028533777_0ya0av86q` shows the user asked `how does the QA agent work in aloops. will it work for any loop`; the first model step immediately called `delegate_to_agent` for `augustus`. In the same conversation (`conv_1773028533776_ldsjpjgh5`), the user later had to send `Use available tools directly via native function-calling, or provide a complete final answer.` The injected prompt in `apps/desktop/src/main/system-prompts.ts` explicitly said `ALWAYS delegate to a matching agent BEFORE responding` and `Only respond directly if NO agent matches the request`.
- Change: Updated `apps/desktop/src/main/system-prompts.ts` so delegation guidance prefers direct execution for simple/local tasks, reserves delegation for explicit/specialized/parallel cases, and tells the agent to incorporate delegated results into a complete answer. Added `apps/desktop/src/main/system-prompts.test.ts` coverage for the new wording.
- After evidence: The delegation prompt no longer contains the mandatory `ALWAYS delegate` / `Only respond directly if NO agent matches` rules, and now contains direct-answer preference plus delegation-result synthesis guidance. Regression test passes against the updated prompt builder.
- Verification commands/run results: `NODE_PATH="$HOME/Development/dotagents-mono/node_modules" "$HOME/Development/dotagents-mono/node_modules/.bin/vitest" run apps/desktop/src/main/system-prompts.test.ts` → passed (`2 tests`). Initial `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop test -- src/main/system-prompts.test.ts` was blocked because this worktree has no local `node_modules`.
- Blockers/remaining uncertainty: I did not perform a live desktop repro because this iteration only changed prompt text and the worktree lacks a local dependency install. Remaining lead: inspect whether delegated-run output selection should prefer explicit `respond_to_user` content more aggressively when sub-agents do run.

## Next promising leads
- Sessions where delegated sub-agent output was low quality or not synthesized cleanly by the parent agent
- Recent traces with tool/generation errors that map to app behavior instead of external provider/network failures
- Runs that ended without satisfying the user in a single agent execution
