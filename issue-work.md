## Issue Work Ledger

- Repo: `aj47/dotagents-mono`
- Started: `2026-03-08`
- Purpose: track issue investigation, assumptions, changes, verification, branch/PR status, and next steps.

### Workflow Notes

- Prefer one small, shippable issue slice at a time.
- Avoid repeating recently investigated issues unless unblocking a known follow-up.
- Record explicit assumptions when issue details are incomplete.

### Iterations

##### Issue #55 — Session tile header UI bugs: duplicate maximize button, repeated agent name, and collapsed tile spacing

- Selection rationale: clear bug report, desktop UX impact, and a narrow local implementation path in the session tile header.
- Investigation:
  - Reviewed issue details/labels (`bug`, `ui`) and confirmed there were no comments or extra requirements.
  - Inspected `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tsx`, `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/session-grid.tsx`, and `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/sessions.tsx`.
  - Confirmed a likely direct cause for the "duplicate maximize button" report: snoozed tiles render both `Show only this session` and `Restore session`, and both use `Maximize2` icons.
- Important assumptions:
  - Assumption: the reported duplicate maximize state is the snoozed-tile case, because that is the only clear path in the current tile header that renders two maximize-style actions at once.
  - Why acceptable: the issue explicitly says it happens only "in certain cases," and this code path matches that conditional behavior exactly.
- Additional assumption for follow-up slice: the repeated agent-name presentation comes from ACP tiles showing agent identity both in the header profile chip and again in the footer `ACPSessionBadge`.
- Why acceptable: the footer badge already presents the richer agent identity (including version/model context), so hiding the header chip only when the ACP badge names the agent reduces repetition without removing unique information.
- Additional assumption for reflow slice: packing collapsed tiles after expanded tiles is an acceptable first fix for the gap problem, even if it does not introduce a full masonry layout.
- Why acceptable: it removes the most visible empty-space problem in the current flex-wrapped grid with a much smaller, safer change than replacing the layout system.
- Changes implemented:
  - Added `showTileExpandAction` so the tile-level maximize action is hidden when the session is snoozed and already exposes `Restore session`.
  - Added a regression assertion in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tile-layout.test.ts` covering the snoozed-tile action gating.
  - Added `showTileProfileName` so ACP-backed tiles do not repeat the header profile chip when the footer `ACPSessionBadge` already names the agent.
  - Added a regression assertion covering the ACP header/footer identity de-duplication.
  - Removed an unused `compact` prop from the tile footer `ACPSessionBadge` call so the invocation matches the component API.
  - Added `orderedVisibleProgressEntries` in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/sessions.tsx` so collapsed tiles are packed after expanded tiles, letting open tiles reclaim the primary grid area.
  - Disabled tile drag-reorder while collapsed packing is active to avoid mismatches between the derived display order and persisted manual order.
  - Added a source-level regression assertion in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/sessions.layout-controls.test.ts` covering collapsed-tile packing.
- Verification run:
  - Attempted: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop test:run -- src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tile-layout.test.ts`
  - Result: blocked by missing local dependencies / `node_modules`; shared pretest failed with `sh: tsup: command not found`.
  - Attempted: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop test:run -- src/renderer/src/pages/sessions.layout-controls.test.ts`
  - Result: blocked for the same reason (`tsup: command not found`, worktree `node_modules` missing).
  - Confidence: code-path confirmation by source inspection is strong for this slice, but automated test execution remains pending until dependencies are installed in this worktree.
- Related branch/PR status:
  - Branch: `aloops/issue-work-loop`
  - PR: not created in this iteration.
- Remaining follow-ups for issue #55:
  - Consider a fuller masonry-style or grid-row-aware reflow if packed collapsed tiles still feel too coarse.
  - Restore manual drag-reorder while collapsed packing is active if that interaction becomes important.

- Next recommended issue work item: switch to another small desktop UX or hub issue after this `#55` slice is committed.

##### Issue #56 — Feature: Hub website — bundle inspector modal (peek inside before installing)

- Investigation note:
  - Reviewed the issue body/comments and inspected `website/index.html`.
  - Current `website/index.html` is a marketing landing page with a hub section, not an obvious bundle-card list surface matching the issue's proposed "Inspect" button placement.
- Decision:
  - Deferred for now to avoid inventing a larger website information architecture in the same pass.
  - Best next step for `#56` is to identify the exact hub card surface or land a deliberate first slice that introduces bundle cards + inspect modal shell together.
