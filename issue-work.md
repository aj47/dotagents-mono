## Issue Work Ledger

- Repo: `aj47/dotagents-mono`
- Started: `2026-03-08`
- Purpose: track issue investigation, assumptions, changes, verification, branch/PR status, and next steps.

### Workflow Notes

- Prefer one small, shippable issue slice at a time.
- Avoid repeating recently investigated issues unless unblocking a known follow-up.
- Record explicit assumptions when issue details are incomplete.

### Iterations

##### Issue #55 — Session tile header UI bugs: duplicate maximize button, repeated agent name, and collapsed tile spacing

- Selection rationale: clear bug report, desktop UX impact, and a narrow local implementation path in the session tile header.
- Investigation:
  - Reviewed issue details/labels (`bug`, `ui`) and confirmed there were no comments or extra requirements.
  - Inspected `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tsx`, `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/session-grid.tsx`, and `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/sessions.tsx`.
  - Confirmed a likely direct cause for the "duplicate maximize button" report: snoozed tiles render both `Show only this session` and `Restore session`, and both use `Maximize2` icons.
- Important assumptions:
  - Assumption: the reported duplicate maximize state is the snoozed-tile case, because that is the only clear path in the current tile header that renders two maximize-style actions at once.
  - Why acceptable: the issue explicitly says it happens only "in certain cases," and this code path matches that conditional behavior exactly.
- Additional assumption for follow-up slice: the repeated agent-name presentation comes from ACP tiles showing agent identity both in the header profile chip and again in the footer `ACPSessionBadge`.
- Why acceptable: the footer badge already presents the richer agent identity (including version/model context), so hiding the header chip only when the ACP badge names the agent reduces repetition without removing unique information.
- Changes implemented:
  - Added `showTileExpandAction` so the tile-level maximize action is hidden when the session is snoozed and already exposes `Restore session`.
  - Added a regression assertion in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tile-layout.test.ts` covering the snoozed-tile action gating.
  - Added `showTileProfileName` so ACP-backed tiles do not repeat the header profile chip when the footer `ACPSessionBadge` already names the agent.
  - Added a regression assertion covering the ACP header/footer identity de-duplication.
  - Removed an unused `compact` prop from the tile footer `ACPSessionBadge` call so the invocation matches the component API.
- Verification run:
  - Attempted: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop test:run -- src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tile-layout.test.ts`
  - Result: blocked by missing local dependencies / `node_modules`; shared pretest failed with `sh: tsup: command not found`.
  - Confidence: code-path confirmation by source inspection is strong for this slice, but automated test execution remains pending until dependencies are installed in this worktree.
- Related branch/PR status:
  - Branch: `aloops/issue-work-loop`
  - PR: not created in this iteration.
- Remaining follow-ups for issue #55:
  - Investigate collapsed-tile reflow; likely requires a layout-level adjustment in `SessionGrid` / `SessionTileWrapper`, not just header chrome.

- Next recommended issue work item: investigate the collapsed-tile reflow slice of `#55`, or switch to another small desktop UX bug after this change is committed.
