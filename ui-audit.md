## 2026-03-06 — chunk 1: settings form responsiveness

### Sources consulted
- `apps/desktop/DEBUGGING.md`
- renderer settings pages/components under `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/`

### Highest-value area selected
- Shared settings form rows (`components/ui/control.tsx`) used across dense settings surfaces.
- First concrete targets: `settings-general.tsx`, `settings-providers.tsx`, `settings-remote-server.tsx`.

### Issues found
- Control rows were hardcoded to a single horizontal layout with the value area capped at ~50%, which is fragile at narrow window widths and larger font scales.
- Long labels/tooltips/end descriptions could feel cramped or wrap poorly.
- Several settings selects used fixed pixel widths only (`w-[120px]`, `w-[180px]`, `w-[200px]`, etc.), increasing the chance of truncation or horizontal pressure.
- Settings pages used desktop-oriented horizontal padding and generic `overflow-auto`, making small-window behavior less polished.

### Changes made
- Updated `Control` to use a stacked-first responsive layout on small widths, switching to horizontal alignment at `sm` and preserving desktop balance.
- Allowed labels and tooltip rows to wrap cleanly with `break-words`/`flex-wrap`.
- Made `ControlGroup` end descriptions use full width on small screens and right-align only on larger widths.
- Changed the most visible fixed-width triggers/inputs in General, Providers, and Remote Server to `w-full sm:w-[...]` patterns.
- Tightened the audited settings page wrappers to `overflow-y-auto overflow-x-hidden px-4 sm:px-6` for better small-window behavior.
- Added a focused regression test for the shared `Control`/`ControlLabel` responsive class contract.

### Follow-up areas for next chunk
- Inspect the live settings sidebar + nested panel structure on `/settings/providers` for any double-panel/double-padding polish issues.
- Audit agents/settings list screens for long-name truncation and empty-state spacing.
- Check mobile/remote surfaces separately; this chunk was desktop renderer settings-focused.
